\chapter*{Contributing}

Help would always be appreciated. Anyone able to read over changes, make suggestions, help
with formatting or play the game would be appreciated. \\

The project is on Github at \url{https://github.com/Find-the-Path/FindThePath}. If you are
proficient with git and/or \LaTeX, merge requests can be added there. Otherwise, I can be
contacted by email, or on a bunch of instant messaging platforms.
