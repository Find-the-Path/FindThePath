A dim, blue glow surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by chaotic creatures, and \textit{slowing }chaotic creatures when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects.\\
First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike \textit{protection from chaos}, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by chaotic creatures.\\
Second, a warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against chaotic spells and spells cast by chaotic creatures.\\
Third, the abjuration protects you from possession and mental influence, just as \textit{protection from chaos }does.\\
Finally, if a chaotic creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the attacker is \textit{slowed }(Will save negates, as the \textit{slow }spell, but against \textit{shield of law}'s save DC).\\
