This spell functions like \textit{symbol of death}, except that all creatures of 10 HD or less within 60 feet of the \textit{symbol of sleep }instead fall into a catatonic slumber for 3d6 Ã— 10 minutes. Unlike with the \textit{sleep }spell, sleeping creatures cannot be awakened by nonmagical means before this time expires.\\
Unlike \textit{symbol of death}, \textit{symbol of sleep }has no hit point limit; once triggered, a \textit{symbol of sleep }simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.\\
\textit{Note}: Magic traps such as \textit{symbol of sleep }are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for \textit{symbol of sleep}.\\
