When you cast \textit{imprisonment }and touch a creature, it is entombed in a state of suspended animation (see the \textit{temporal stasis }spell) in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the ground. The subject remains there unless a \textit{freedom }spell is cast at the locale where the imprisonment took place. Magical search by a \textit{crystal ball, }a \textit{locate object }spell, or some other similar divination does not reveal the fact that a creature is imprisoned, but \textit{discern location }does. A \textit{wish }or \textit{miracle }spell will not free the recipient, but will reveal where it is entombed. If you know the target's name and some facts about its life, the target takes a --4 penalty on its save.\\
