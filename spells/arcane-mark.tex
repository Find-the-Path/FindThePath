This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or mark, which can consist of no more than six characters. The writing can be visible or invisible. An \textit{arcane mark }spell enables you to etch the rune upon any substance without harm to the material upon which it is placed. If an invisible mark is made, a \textit{detect magic }spell causes it to glow and be visible, though not necessarily understandable.\\
\textit{See invisibility, true seeing}, a \textit{gem of seeing}, or a \textit{robe of eyes }likewise allows the user to see an invisible \textit{arcane mark. }A \textit{read magic }spell reveals the words, if any. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an \textit{erase }spell.\\
If an \textit{arcane mark }is placed on a living being, the effect gradually fades in about a month.\\
\textit{Arcane mark }must be cast on an object prior to casting \textit{instant summons }on the same object (see that spell description for details).\\
