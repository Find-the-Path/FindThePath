The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination spells such as \textit{clairaudience/clairvoyance, locate object, }and \textit{detect }spells. \textit{Nondetection }also prevents location by such magic items as \textit{crystal ball}s. If a divination is attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast \textit{nondetection}. If you cast \textit{nondetection }on yourself or on an item currently in your possession, the DC is 15 + your caster level.\\
If cast on a creature, \textit{nondetection }wards the creature's gear as well as the creature itself.\\
