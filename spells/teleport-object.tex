\spellentry{Teleport Object}
\textbf{School} conjuration (teleportation); \textbf{Level} sorcerer/wizard 7\\

\textbf{Target} one touched object of up to 50 lbs./level and 3 cu. ft./level\\
\textbf{Saving Throw }Will negates (object); \textbf{Spell Resistance} yes (object)\\
This spell functions like \textit{teleport, }except that it teleports an object, not you. Creatures and magical forces cannot be teleported.\\
If desired, the target object can be sent to a distant location on the Ethereal Plane. In this case, the point from which the object was teleported remains faintly magical until the item is retrieved. A successful targeted \textit{dispel magic }spell cast on that point brings the vanished item back from the Ethereal Plane.\\
