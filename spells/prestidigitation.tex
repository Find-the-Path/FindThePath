Prestidigitations are minor tricks that novice spellcasters use for practice. Once cast, a \textit{prestidigitation }spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour. The effects are minor and have severe limitations. A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1 pound of material. It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round. It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material. It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters. \textit{Prestidigitation }can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created by a \textit{prestidigitation }spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components. Finally, \textit{prestidigitation }lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour.\\
