This spell turns an oak tree into a protector or guardian. The spell can only be cast on a single tree at a time; while \textit{liveoak }is in effect, you can't cast it again on another tree. \textit{Liveoak }must be cast on a healthy, Huge oak. A triggering phrase of up to one word per caster level is placed on the targeted oak. The \textit{liveoak }spell triggers the tree into animating as a treant. \\
If \textit{liveoak }is dispelled, the tree takes root immediately wherever it happens to be. If released by you, the tree tries to return to its original location before taking root.\\
