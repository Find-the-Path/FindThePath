You move yourself or some other creature to another plane of existence or alternate dimension. If several willing persons link hands in a circle, as many as eight can be affected by the \textit{plane shift }at the same time. Precise accuracy as to a particular arrival location on the intended plane is nigh impossible. From the Material Plane, you can reach any other plane, though you appear 5 to 500 miles (5d%) from your intended destination. \textit{Plane shift }transports creatures instantaneously and then ends. The creatures need to find other means if they are to travel back (including casting \textit{plane shift} again).\\
