An \textit{arcane lock }spell cast upon a door, chest, or portal magically locks it. You can freely pass your own \textit{arcane lock }without affecting it. If the locked object has a lock, the DC to open that lock increases by 10 while it remains attached to the object. If the object does not have a lock, this spell creates one that can only be opened with a DC 20 Disable Device skill check. A door or object secured with this spell can be opened only by breaking in or with a successful \textit{dispel magic }or \textit{knock }spell. Add 10 to the normal DC to break open a door or portal affected by this spell. A \textit{knock }spell does not remove an \textit{arcane lock; }it only suppresses the effect for 10 minutes.\\
