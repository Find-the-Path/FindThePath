The subject is protected from all devices and spells that gather information about the target through divination magic (such as \textit{detect evil, locate creature, scry, }and\textit{ see invisible}). This spell also grants a +8 resistance bonus on saving throws against all mind-affecting spells and effects. \textit{Mind blank }even foils \textit{limited wish}, \textit{miracle}, and \textit{wish }spells when they are used in such a way as to gain information about the target. In the case of scrying that scans an area the creature is in, such as \textit{arcane eye, }the spell works but the creature simply isn't detected. Scrying attempts that are targeted specifically at the subject do not work at all.\\
