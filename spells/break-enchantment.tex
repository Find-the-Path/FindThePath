This spell frees victims from enchantments, transmutations, and curses. \textit{Break enchantment }can reverse even an instantaneous effect. For each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect. For a cursed magic item, the DC is equal to the DC of the curse.\\
If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by \textit{dispel magic} or \textit{stone to flesh}, \textit{break enchantment }works only if that spell is 5th level or lower. \\
If the effect comes from a permanent magic item, \textit{break enchantment }does not remove the curse from the item, but it does free the victim from the item's effects. \\
