This spell functions like \textit{symbol of death}, except that all creatures within the radius of the \textit{symbol of insanity }instead become permanently insane (as the \textit{insanity }spell).\\
Unlike \textit{symbol of death}, symbol of insanity has no hit point limit; once triggered, a \textit{symbol of insanity }simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.\\
\textit{Note}: Magic traps such as \textit{symbol of insanity }are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for \textit{symbol of insanity}.\\
