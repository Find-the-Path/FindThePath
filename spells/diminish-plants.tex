This spell has two versions.\\
\textit{Prune Growth}: This version of the spell causes normal vegetation within long range (400 feet + 40 feet per level) to shrink to about one-third normal size, becoming untangled and less bushy. The affected vegetation appears to have been carefully pruned and trimmed. This version of \textit{diminish plants} automatically dispels any spells or effects that enhance plants, such as \textit{entangle, plant growth, }and \textit{wall of thorns}.\\
At your option, the area can be a 100-foot-radius circle, a 150-foot-radius semicircle, or a 200-foot-radius quarter-circle. You may also designate portions of the area that are not affected.\\
\textit{Stunt Growth}: This version of the spell targets all normal plants within a range of 1/2 mile, reducing their potential productivity over the course of the following year to half normal. \\
This spell has no effect on plant creatures.\\
