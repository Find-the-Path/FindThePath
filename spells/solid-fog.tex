This spell functions like \textit{fog cloud}, but in addition to obscuring sight, the \textit{solid fog} is so thick that it impedes movement. Creatures moving through a \textit{solid fog} move at half their normal speed and take a â€“2 penalty on all melee attack and melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into \textit{solid fog} is slowed so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces the falling damage by 1d6. A creature cannot take a 5-foot-step while in \textit{solid fog}. \textit{Solid fog}, and effects that work like \textit{solid fog}, do not stack with each other in terms of slowed movement and attack penalties.\\
Unlike normal fog, only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it does so in 1 round.\\
\textit{Solid fog }can be made permanent with a \textit{permanency }spell. A permanent \textit{solid fog }dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.\\
