A \textit{limited wish }lets you create nearly any type of effect. For example, a \textit{limited wish }can do any of the following things.\\
A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DC is for a 7th-level spell. When a \textit{limited wish }spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 1,000 gp, you must provide that component (in addition to the 1,500 gp diamond component for this spell).\\
