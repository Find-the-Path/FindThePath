\textbf{School} illusion (phantasm) [fear, mind-affecting]; \textbf{Level} sorcerer/wizard 9\\
\textbf{Targets} any number of creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart\\
This spell functions like \textit{phantasmal killer}, except it can affect more than one creature. Only the affected creatures see the phantasmal creatures attacking them, though you see the attackers as shadowy shapes.\\
If a subject's Fortitude save succeeds, it still takes 3d6 points of damage and is stunned for 1 round. The subject also takes 1d4 points of Strength damage.\\
