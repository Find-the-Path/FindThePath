When cast, this spell prevents divination spells from detecting or locating the target and also renders the affected target invisible (as the \textit{invisibility }spell). The spell does not prevent the subject from being discovered through tactile means or through the use of devices. Creatures affected by \textit{sequester }become comatose and are effectively in a state of suspended animation until the spell ends.\\
\textit{Note}: The Will save prevents an attended or magical object from being \textit{sequestered. }There is no save to see the \textit{sequestered }creature or object or to detect it with a divination spell.\\
