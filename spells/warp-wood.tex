\spellentry{Warp Wood}
\textbf{School} transmutation; \textbf{Level} druid 2\\
\textbf{Casting Time} 1 standard action\\
\textbf{Components} V, S\\
\textbf{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)\\
\textbf{Target} 1 Small wooden object/level, all within a 20-ft. radius\\
\textbf{Duration} instantaneous\\
\textbf{Saving Throw }Will negates (object); \textbf{Spell Resistance} yes (object)\\
You cause wood to bend and warp, permanently destroying its straightness, form, and strength. A warped door springs open (or becomes stuck, requiring a Strength check to open, at your option). A boat or ship springs a leak. Warped ranged weapons are useless. A warped melee weapon causes a --4 penalty on attack rolls.\\
You may warp one Small or smaller object or its equivalent per caster level. A Medium object counts as two Small objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as 16, and a Colossal object as 32.\\
Alternatively, you can unwarp wood (effectively warping it back to normal) with this spell. \textit{Make whole}, on the other hand, does no good in repairing a warped item.\\
You can combine multiple consecutive \textit{warp wood }spells to warp (or unwarp) an object that is too large for you to warp with a single spell. Until the object is completely warped, it suffers no ill effects.\\
