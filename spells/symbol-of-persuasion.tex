This spell functions like \textit{symbol of death}, except that all creatures within the radius of a \textit{symbol of persuasion }instead become charmed by the caster (as the \textit{charm monster }spell) for 1 hour per caster level.\\
Unlike \textit{symbol of death}, \textit{symbol of persuasion }has no hit point limit; once triggered, a \textit{symbol of persuasion }simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.\\
\textit{Note}: Magic traps such as \textit{symbol of persuasion }are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 31 for \textit{symbol of persuasion}.\\
