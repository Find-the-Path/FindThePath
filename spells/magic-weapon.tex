\spellentry{Magic Weapon}
\textbf{School} transmutation; \textbf{Level} cleric 1, paladin 1, sorcerer/wizard 1\\
\textbf{Casting Time} 1 standard action\\
\textbf{Components} V, S, DF\\
\textbf{Range} touch\\
\textbf{Target }weapon touched\\
\textbf{Duration} 1 min./level\\
\textbf{Saving Throw }Will negates (harmless, object); \textbf{Spell Resistance} yes (harmless, object)\\
\textit{Magic weapon }gives a weapon a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. An enhancement bonus does not stack with a masterwork weapon's +1 bonus on attack rolls.\\
You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike (instead, see \textit{magic fang}). A monk's unarmed strike is considered a weapon, and thus it can be enhanced by this spell.\\
\textbf{Magic Weapon, Greater}\\
\textbf{School} transmutation; \textbf{Level} cleric 4, paladin 3, sorcerer/wizard 3\\
\textbf{Casting Time} 1 standard action\\
\textbf{Components} V, S, M/DF (powdered lime and carbon)\\
\textbf{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)\\
\textbf{Target} one weapon or 50 projectiles (all of which must be together at the time of casting)\\
\textbf{Duration} 1 hour/level\\
\textbf{Saving Throw }Will negates (harmless, object); \textbf{Spell Resistance} yes (harmless, object)\\
This spell functions like \textit{magic weapon, }except that it gives a weapon an enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls of +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5). This bonus does not allow a weapon to bypass damage reduction aside from magic.\\
Alternatively, you can affect as many as 50 arrows, bolts, or bullets. The projectiles must be of the same kind, and they have to be together (in the same quiver or other container). Projectiles, but not thrown weapons, lose their transmutation after they are used. Treat shuriken as projectiles, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell.\\
