An affected creature moves and attacks at a drastically slowed rate. Creatures affected by this spell are staggered and can take only a single move action or standard action each turn, but not both (nor may it take full-round actions). Additionally, it takes a â€“1 penalty on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves. A \textit{slowed }creature moves at half its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot increment), which affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for decreased speed.\\
Multiple \textit{slow }effects don't stack. \textit{Slow }counters and dispels \textit{haste}.\\
