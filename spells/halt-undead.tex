This spell renders as many as three undead creatures immobile. A nonintelligent undead creature gets no saving throw; an intelligent undead creature does. If the spell is successful, it renders the undead creature immobile for the duration of the spell (similar to the effect of \textit{hold person }on a living creature). The effect is broken if the \textit{halted }creatures are attacked or take damage.\\
