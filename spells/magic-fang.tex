This spell functions like \textit{magic fang}, except that the enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls is +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5). This bonus does not allow a natural weapon or unarmed strike to bypass damage reduction aside from magic.\\
Alternatively, you may imbue all of the creature's natural weapons with a +1 enhancement bonus (regardless of your caster level).\\
\textit{Greater magic fang }can be made permanent with a \textit{permanency }spell.\\
