This spell functions like \textit{symbol of death}, except that all creatures within 60 feet of the \textit{symbol of fear }instead become panicked for 1 round per caster level.\\
\textit{Note}: Magic traps such as \textit{symbol of fear }are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 31 for \textit{symbol of fear}.\\
