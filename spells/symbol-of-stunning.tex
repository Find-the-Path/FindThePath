This spell functions like \textit{symbol of death}, except that all creatures within 60 feet of a \textit{symbol of stunning }instead become stunned for 1d6 rounds.\\
\textit{Note}: Magic traps such as \textit{symbol of stunning }are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it.
