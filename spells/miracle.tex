You don't so much cast a \textit{miracle }as request one. You state what you would like to have happen and request that your deity (or the power you pray to for spells) intercede.\\
A \textit{miracle }can do any of the following things.\\
Alternatively, a cleric can make a very powerful request. Casting such a \textit{miracle }costs the cleric 25,000 gp in powdered diamond because of the powerful divine energies involved. Examples of especially powerful \textit{miracles }of this sort could include the following:\\
In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity's (or alignment's) nature is refused.\\
A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DCs are as for a 9th-level spell. When a \textit{miracle }spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 100 gp, you must provide that component.\\
