A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects. Outlined subjects shed light as candles. Creatures outlined by \textit{faerie fire} take a --20 penalty on all Stealth checks. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness (though a 2nd-level or higher magical \textit{darkness }effect functions normally), \textit{blur}, \textit{displacement, invisibility,} or similar effects. The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light. The \textit{faerie fire }can be blue, green, or violet, according to your choice at the time of casting. The \textit{faerie fire }does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.\\
