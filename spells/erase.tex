\textit{Erase }removes writings of either magical or mundane nature from a scroll or from one or two pages of paper, parchment, or similar surfaces. With this spell, you can remove \textit{explosive runes, }a \textit{glyph of warding, }a \textit{sepia snake sigil, }or an \textit{arcane mark}, but not \textit{illusory script }or a \textit{symbol }spell. Nonmagical writing is automatically erased if you touch it and no one else is holding it. Otherwise, the chance of erasing nonmagical writing is 90%.\\
Magic writing must be touched to be erased, and you also must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against DC 15. A natural 1 is always a failure on this check. If you fail to erase \textit{explosive runes}, a \textit{glyph of warding}, or a \textit{sepia snake sigil}, you accidentally activate that writing instead.\\
