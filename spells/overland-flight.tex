\textbf{Components}: V, S\\
\textbf{Range} personal\\
\textbf{Target} you\\
\textbf{Duration} 1 hour/level\\
This spell functions like a \textit{fly }spell, except you can fly at a speed of 40 feet (30 feet if wearing medium or heavy armor, or if carrying a medium or heavy load) with a bonus on Fly skill checks equal to half your caster level. When using this spell for long-distance movement, you can hustle without taking nonlethal damage (a forced march still requires Constitution checks). This means you can cover 64 miles in an 8-hour period of flight (or 48 miles at a speed of 30 feet).\\
