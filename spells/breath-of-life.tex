This spell cures 5d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25). \\
Unlike other spells that heal damage, \textit{breath of life} can bring recently slain creatures back to life. If cast upon a creature that has died within 1 round, apply the healing from this spell to the creature. If the healed creature's hit point total is at a negative amount less than its Constitution score, it comes back to life and stabilizes at its new hit point total. If the creature's hit point total is at a negative amount equal to or greater than its Constitution score, the creature remains dead. Creatures brought back to life through \textit{breath of life} gain a temporary negative level that lasts for 1 day.\\
Creatures slain by death effects cannot be saved by \textit{breath of life}.\\
Like cure spells, \textit{breath of life} deals damage to undead creatures rather than curing them, and cannot bring them back to life.\\
