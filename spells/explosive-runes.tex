You trace mystic runes upon a book, map, scroll, or similar object bearing written information. The \textit{explosive runes }detonate when read, dealing 6d6 points of force damage. Anyone next to the \textit{explosive runes }(close enough to read them) takes the full damage with no saving throw; any other creature within 10 feet of the \textit{explosive runes }is entitled to a Reflex save for half damage. The object on which the \textit{explosive runes }were written also takes full damage (no saving throw).\\
You and any characters you specifically instruct can read the protected writing without triggering the \textit{explosive runes. }Likewise, you can remove the \textit{explosive runes }whenever desired. Another creature can remove them with a successful \textit{dispel magic }or \textit{erase }spell, but attempting to dispel or erase the \textit{explosive runes }and failing to do so triggers the explosion.\\
Magic traps such as \textit{explosive runes }are hard to detect and disable. A character with the trapfinding class feature (only) can use Disable Device to thwart \textit{explosive runes}. The DC to find magic traps using Perception and to disable them is 25 + spell level, or 28 for \textit{explosive runes}.\\
