A green ray springs from your hand. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target. Any creature or object struck by the ray is covered with a shimmering emerald field that completely blocks extradimensional travel. Forms of movement barred by a \textit{dimensional anchor }include \textit{astral projection, blink, dimension door, ethereal jaunt, etherealness, gate, maze, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, }and similar spell-like abilities. The spell also prevents the use of a \textit{gate }or \textit{teleportation circle }for the duration of the spell.\\
A \textit{dimensional anchor }does not interfere with the movement of creatures already in ethereal or astral form when the spell is cast, nor does it block extradimensional perception or attack forms. Also, \textit{dimensional anchor }does not prevent summoned creatures from disappearing at the end of a summoning spell.\\
