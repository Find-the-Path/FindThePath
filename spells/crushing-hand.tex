\spellentry{Crushing Hand}
\textbf{School }evocation [force]; \textbf{Level }sorcerer/wizard 9\\
This spell functions as \textit{interposing hand}, except that it can also grapple one opponent as \textit{grasping hand}. Its CMB and CMD for grapple checks use your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +12 bonus for its Strength score (35) and a +1 bonus for being Large (its Dexterity is 10, granting no bonus to the CMD). A \textit{crushing hand }deals 2d6+12 points of damage on each successful grapple check against an opponent. The \textit{crushing hand} can instead be directed to bull rush a target (as \textit{forceful hand}), using the same bonuses outlined above, or it can be directed to interpose itself, as \textit{interposing hand} does.\\
