\textit{Wish }is the mightiest spell a wizard or sorcerer can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality to better suit you. Even \textit{wish}, however, has its limits. A \textit{wish }can produce any one of the following effects.\\
You may try to use a \textit{wish }to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. (The \textit{wish }may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment, at the GM's discretion.)\\
Duplicated spells allow saves and spell resistance as normal (but save DCs are for 9th-level spells).\\
When a \textit{wish }duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 10,000 gp, you must provide that component (in addition to the 25,000 gp diamond component for this spell).\\
