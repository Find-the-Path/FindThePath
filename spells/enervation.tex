\textbf{Casting Time} 1 standard action\\
\textbf{Components} V, S\\

\textbf{Effect} ray of negative energy\\
\textbf{Duration} instantaneous\\
\textbf{Saving Throw} none; \textbf{Spell Resistance} yes\\
You point your finger and fire a black ray of negative energy that suppresses the life force of any living creature it strikes. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit. If you hit, the subject gains 1d4 temporary negative levels (see Special Abilities). Negative levels stack.\\
Assuming the subject survives, it regains lost levels after a number of hours equal to your caster level (maximum 15 hours). Usually, negative levels have a chance of becoming permanent, but the negative levels from \textit{enervation }don't last long enough to do so.\\
An undead creature struck by the ray gains 1d4 Ã— 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour.\\
