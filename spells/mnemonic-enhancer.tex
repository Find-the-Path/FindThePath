Casting this spell allows you to prepare additional spells or retain spells recently cast. Pick one of these two versions when the spell is cast.\\
\textit{Prepare}: You prepare up to three additional levels of spells. A cantrip counts as 1/2 level for this purpose. You prepare and cast these spells normally.\\
\textit{Retain}: You retain any spell of 3rd level or lower that you had cast up to 1 round before you started casting the \textit{mnemonic enhancer}. This restores the previously cast spell to your mind.\\
In either event, the spell or spells prepared or retained fade after 24 hours (if not cast).\\
